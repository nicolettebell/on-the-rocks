# about
Check out the site <a href="https://nicolettebell.github.io/on-the-rocks/index.html">here</a><br>
This is my final project for the Code First Girls Introduction to Web Development course.
I only accidentally stayed up until 3am once while working on it 🙃<br>
I built this site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I based the theme of the site around my love of mixology. The site has a relatively minimal design and features an age gate landing page, home page, about page, recipe list, and a contact form.

# project requirements
<b>must have:</b>
- [x] At least 2 HTML pages and one external CSS file
- [x] Consistent navbar on all pages
- [x] Styled well
- [x] All links working
- [x] Basic user interaction (ex: hover, submit form, action on click)

<b>nice to have:</b>
- [ ] Mobile-responsive website
- [x] Effective use of classes and IDs
- [x] JavaScript used to enable user interaction

# challenges
- i was definitely daunted by the task of making the site mobile responsive
- i found (maybe the hardest possible) ways to do things rather than use flex boxes where I could've... the title redirecting to the home page could've been done in a much simpler way, I'm sure
- implementing modal windows took quite a while as I tried several different methods before finding one that fit what I was picturing

# to add in the future
- [ ] make mobile responsive
- [ ] overlay with title on image hover
- [ ] enable cookies for agegate
- [ ] either functional php contact form OR dialog box on form submit success
- [ ] fix font colours in nav bar
